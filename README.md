# TRADUNGEON
#### TRADUNGEON is a survival dungeon trading game.
You are trapped in a dungeon and there's only one way out.  
You must earn money to prepare food for your journey towards the exit.  
Try to get out of this dungeon before it transforms itself into a completely new terrain.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics
#### Loot
- Explore the randomly generated dungeon and find valuable treasures.

#### Craft
- Make advanced items by combining raw materials.
- Crafted items are generally more expansive.
- Crafted foods are much more effective at dealing with hunger.

#### Trade
- There are other people trapped inside the dungeon.  
- Find them and buy or sell items.  
- Harness the nature of fluctuating market price to earn money.  
How much the NPCs value each item changes everyday.  
Try to buy cheap and sell expensive!  

#### Survive
- Make sure you control hunger and thirst.  
- You can loot food from the dungeon or buy them from NPCs.  
- Look for water tiles to stay hydrated.
