# TRADUNGEON
#### TRADUNGEON is a survival dungeon trading game.
You are trapped in a dungeon and there's only one way out.  
You must earn money and bribe the dragon that's keeping the dungeon's exit.  

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

#### Loot
- Explore the randomly generated dungeon and find valuable treasures.

#### Craft
- Make your own item by combining raw materials.

#### Trade
- There are other people trapped inside the dungeon.  
- Find them and buy or sell items.  
- Harness the nature of fluctuating market price to earn money.  
How much the NPCs value each item changes everyday.  
Try to buy cheap and sell expensive!

#### Survive
- Make sure you control hunger and thirst.  
- You can loot food and water from the dungeon or buy from NPCs.  
- Raw food and water have chance of poisoning,  
so you'd better cook or boil things before you consume.
