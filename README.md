# TRADUNGEON
#### TRADUNGEON is a survival dungeon trading game.
You are trapped in a dungeon and there's only one way out.  
You must earn money to prepare food for your journey towards the exit.  
Try to get out of this dungeon before it transforms itself into a completely new terrain.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

#### Loot
- Explore the randomly generated dungeon and find valuable treasures.

#### Craft

#### Trade
- There are other people trapped inside the dungeon.
